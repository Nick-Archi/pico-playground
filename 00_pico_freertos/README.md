# FreeRTOS sample Pico Program

I am starting to get into playing around with the FreeRTOS project.
- This repo was copied from the pico-examples/freertos/ 
- I played around with the CMakeLists.txt file in order to get the project to build locally on my computer
- I may in the future move this to it's own repo but that would require me chaning directories that would affect the general pico project so I am using this for testing grounds for now.
