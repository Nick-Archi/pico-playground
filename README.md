# Flexing on the Raspberry Pi Pico

Welcome to my project repo!

---

## Intent

I want to continue my interest in the Raspberry Pi Pico and re-explore areas I learned about in college and find new fields of interest. Think of this as my playground

I've used some microcontrollers back in college:
- 3pi Robot (ATmega328)
- Tiva C Launchpad (ARM Cortex-M4F)
- Lego Mindstorms NXT_2.0
- Raspberry Pi 2 (ARM Cortex-A7)

## Background

This is more a personal project, intended to build back up my confidence in tinkering with small devices.

## Topics

Some things I want to accomplish:<br> 
[] UART communication with Pico<br>
[] ...more to come!
