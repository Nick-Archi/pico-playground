## Intent

I want to continue my interest in the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP 2350) and re-explore areas I learned about in college and find new fields of interest. Think of this as my playground

I've used some microcontrollers back in college:
- 3pi Robot (ATmega328)
- Tiva C Launchpad (ARM Cortex-M4F)
- Lego Mindstorms NXT_2.0
- Raspberry Pi 2 (ARM Cortex-A7)

## Background

This is more a personal project, intended to build back up my confidence in tinkering with small devices.

## Setup

Steps that I followed from the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK to setup the SDK for use in all of my projects in this repo.

1. Setup project to point to Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
    * Creating a ~/.bashrc and entering the path
    ```
    export PICO_SDK_PATH=<USER-DEFINED-PATH>
    ```

## Topics

Some things I want to accomplish:<br> 
[] UART communication with Pico<br>
[] Multicore interaction on Pico<br>
[] Utilizing RISC-V core on Pico<br>
[] I2C communication
[] ...more to come!
