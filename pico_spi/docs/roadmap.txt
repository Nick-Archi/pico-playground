Lame_Bitmap Roadmap

Realized I needed to try and build a roadmap for what functionality I intend to bring with
this development of the lame_bitmap

Functionality:
[ x ] Convert a char into it's corresponding digit or letter
[ x ] Write strings to specific pages to display on OLED
[ x ] Write full on sentences to the OLED?

Objectives:
[ x ] Converting char -> corresponding digit/letter:
    -- modifying source files:
[ x ] Create string to bitmap functionality
    -- ex) "hello" -> "HELLO" on OLED
        -- start with 1st char
        -- obtain the bitmap location for it
        -- write the bitmap into the location in buffer
        -- increment to next char and increment next spot in buffer
        -- repeat
        
[ ] Work on writing a page at a time instead of cycling through all pages...     
    -- likely modify these functions:    
    
[ ] Possibly work on functionality to write more than (16 * 8) bytes to the page. This will cause the page offset to increase to the next page and for the offset to reset
    -- some type of modulus functionality?
    -- start looking at the write_string() in SH1106_Interactions.c
        -- when offset/idx gets to 17, it doesn't write the remainder to the OLED
        -- pos_start is also buggy. What happens if I wanted to start writing at position 26 in the buffer?
