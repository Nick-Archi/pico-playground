Lame_Bitmap Roadmap

Realized I needed to try and build a roadmap for what functionality I intend to bring with
this development of the lame_bitmap

Functionality:
[ x ] Convert a char into it's corresponding digit or letter
[ ] Write strings to specific pages to display on OLED
[ ] Write full on sentences to the OLED?

Objectives:
[ x ] Converting char -> corresponding digit/letter:
    -- modifying source files:
[ x ] Create string to bitmap functionality
    -- ex) "hello" -> "HELLO" on OLED
        -- start with 1st char
        -- obtain the bitmap location for it
        -- write the bitmap into the location in buffer
        -- increment to next char and increment next spot in buffer
        -- repeat
        
[ ] Work on writing a page at a time instead of cycling through all pages...     
    -- likely modify these functions:
