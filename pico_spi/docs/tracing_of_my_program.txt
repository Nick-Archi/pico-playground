Tracing my code so far...

...theoretically, program execution will start @ main... in Adafruit_SH1106.c
[] The Pico2 will be connected to the SPI peripheral (OLED) prior connecting it to USB
[] Once USB is connected (and assuming the board has already been flashed with the .uf2 file), then start setting up the SPI communication with the Adafruit OLED

[] Intialize the Adafruit_SH1106 object since this will contain the GPIO configuration used throughout

** So I need to make sure that my functions are follwing this order:
[] Reset the connected OLED by:
	- setting the RESET pin HIGH, delaying (10ms?)
	- setting RESET to LOW and delaying
	- setting RESET to HIGH and delaying 
	
[] Initialize SPI communication
	- set the CS pin HIGH to showcase no communication to chip yet
	- initialize the reset of the lines used for SPI communication
	
** So far my execution should follow: 
	- call, init_Adafruit_SH1106
	- call, initialize_spi(), resets the SH1106 board and sets up SPI
	- configure_Adafruit_SH1106(), sends commands to startup SH1106
